# Javascript values and variables
- Name variable using camel casing like 'firstName', cause 'FirstName' kind of naming variable is generely used for object oriented programming in Javascript .
- Only two symbols `_` and `$` are allowed in naming a variable besides number and letters.
- All capital variables (e.g. let PI = 3.14 ) are reserved for constants.
Example:
```Javascript
function myFunction() {
}
```

# Data Types
- javascript programs execute from top to bottom.
- In javascript values have a type not variables .
- When a variable for the firstime you have to type 'let'(e.g. let myAge = 20; ), but when are reassigning it's value you don't have to declare it (e.g. myAge = true;) .
- An empty variable is 'undefined' in value and type .

- **there is a Bug in 'typeof' [e.g. console.log(typeof null)] oparator**
     - that is it shows 'null' as an Object .


# let,const and var
- const is constant which value never changes.
- you should generally use 'const' to declare variables, so you can choose which variables are allowed to change.
** Basic Operators
- There are many types of oparators.

math opretators
---------------
Math operetors are simply +,-,*,/,**

 Comparison operators
--------------------
<,>,>= (greater or equal),<= (less or equal)
** assignment operators
- = (e.g. let x = 10 + 5)
- += (e.g. x += 10 // x = x + 10)
- *= (e.g. x *= 4 // x = x * 4)
- ++ (e.g. x++ // x = x + 1)
- -- (e.g. x-- // x = x - 1)
