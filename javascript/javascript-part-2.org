* Strict mode
To make javascript a little more debugging friendly use strict mode.To use it you have to just start the file with: 'use strict';
* Functions
Functions in javascript is not a type but a value, so it can be stored in a variable.
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
// FUnction declaration
function calcAge1(birthyear) {
    return 2022 - birthyear;
}
const age1 = calcAge1(2002);
console.log(age1);

// Function expression
const calcAge2 = function (birthyear) {
    return 2022 - birthyear;
}
const age2 = calcAge2(2002);
console.log(age2);

#+END_SRC
* Arrow function
It was added in ES6; it is simply a shorter type of function expression.It's value is returned implicitly.
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
const calcAge3 = birthyear => 2022 - birthyear;
const age3 = calcAge3(2002);
console.log(age3);
#+END_SRC
* Fuctions calling other functions

* array and objects
In array you can't name the values, but in objects you can and in objects the value can change order but in array it won't change order.
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
//array
const friend = ['Manob','Biswas','student',0];
//object
const me = {
    firstName: 'Hrittik',
    lastName: 'Biswas',
    job: 'student',
    income: 0
}
#+END_SRC
